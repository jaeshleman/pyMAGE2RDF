The classes and execution script enable the tranformation of MAGE-ML
documents into RDF following the Array Express MAGE object model. Input
files are xml documents following the MAGE-ML specifications.  Output is
serialized as n-triples or n3 notation files.

This representation does not currently attempt to align the output with 
any extant ontology for MAGE or other gene expression studies.
